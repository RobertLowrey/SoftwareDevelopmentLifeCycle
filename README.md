# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Needs tend to deal with the underlining problem. In order to get past the wants from the client and get to the needs we need to understand the root of the problem. To get to the root of the problem we use the five-why's becasue it generally takes five times of asking "why?" to find out the root cause of the need rather than what the client wants. Creating user stories help with this becasue they go in depth of what the client is really needing done from the team. The user stories are clear-to-all, and are transparent of what needs to be done from the team.

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I currently approach develiping programs the wrong way, and im learning that for sure. Meaning that I just go for it rather than plan what is needed to be done, causing me to be lost and confused. It used to work with english papers but not with software. This is changing and im very glad that things are uplifting and becoming a little less stressful. An agile process I will be incorporating will be a burndown charts. I also would like to incorportate a whiteboard to keep progress of my current project progress. 

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member to me is someone that you can really rely on when times get tough. They talk to you, and check in on you to see how you are doing. A good team member listens and reciprocates the transparency others are giving to him/her. A good team member also engages and helps others when there is an issue or a dilema that needs to be solved. Most importantly, a great team player will be responsible for their work and are willing to put in what it takes to accomplish the overall goal.
